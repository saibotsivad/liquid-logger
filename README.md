# Liquid Logger

Hey there! My name is [Tobias](https://davistobias.com), just for fun I'm building a webapp using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [abstract-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router).

I'm streaming it [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/saibotsivad), so follow along if you want to watch me build a modern single-page webapp live.

Check out the code here, and if you have any questions or comments, you can do that there as well by [opening an issue](https://github.com/saibotsivad/liquid-logger/issues/new).

## Build

If you want to follow along on your own, you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I'm using version 12+).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:saibotsivad/liquid-logger.git
cd liquid-logger
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will build all assets and start a server at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), rebuilding on any file changes.
